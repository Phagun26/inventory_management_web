## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview
The Inventory Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline inventory operations for organizations of all sizes. It provides a robust platform for managing products, tracking inventory movements, and maintaining detailed transaction histories. The system is built with scalability in mind, allowing organizations to manage their inventory efficiently while maintaining data integrity and security. The application supports multiple organizations, each with their own set of users, products, and inventory operations, making it suitable for both small businesses and large enterprises.

### 1.2 Key Features
The system offers a wide range of features designed to meet the needs of modern inventory management:

- **Multi-organization support**: The system is designed to handle multiple organizations simultaneously, with each organization having its own isolated data and user base. This allows service providers to offer inventory management as a service to multiple clients.

- **Role-based access control**: A sophisticated permission system ensures that users can only access and modify data they are authorized to handle. This includes different levels of access for administrators, managers, and regular users.

- **Real-time inventory tracking**: The system provides up-to-the-minute information about inventory levels, with automatic updates whenever stock movements occur. This helps prevent stockouts and overstocking situations.

- **Transaction history logging**: Every action in the system is recorded with detailed information about who performed the action, when it was performed, and what changes were made. This creates a comprehensive audit trail for compliance and accountability.

- **Rack-based inventory management**: Products are organized using a rack-based system, allowing for precise location tracking and efficient warehouse management. Each rack can be assigned specific products and quantities.

- **Pending inventory operations**: The system includes a workflow for approving inventory changes, ensuring that all modifications are reviewed and authorized before being implemented. This helps prevent errors and unauthorized changes.

- **User activity monitoring**: All user actions are tracked and logged, providing administrators with visibility into system usage and helping to identify potential security issues or training needs.

### 1.3 Technology Stack
The system is built using a modern and robust technology stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript provides a powerful and type-safe foundation for the user interface. The framework's server-side rendering capabilities ensure fast initial page loads and improved SEO.

- **Backend**: Next.js API routes handle all server-side logic, providing a seamless integration between frontend and backend code. This architecture simplifies deployment and maintenance.

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM offers a reliable and scalable data storage solution. Prisma provides type-safe database access and automatic schema migrations.

- **Authentication**: A custom JWT-based system ensures secure user authentication and session management. The system includes features like token refresh and secure cookie handling.

- **State Management**: React Context API manages application state, providing a clean and efficient way to share data between components without prop drilling.

- **UI Components**: Custom components built with Tailwind CSS create a consistent and responsive user interface. The design system includes dark mode support and accessibility features.
