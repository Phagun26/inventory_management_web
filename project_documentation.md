   - Can manage all users
   - Can perform all operations

2. **Organization Admin**
   - Organization-level access
   - Can manage organization users
   - Can manage organization inventory
   - Can approve operations

3. **Regular User**
   - Limited access
   - Can view inventory
   - Can create operations
   - Can view transaction history

### 5.3 Security Measures
The system implements multiple security measures:

1. **Authentication Security**
   - bcrypt password hashing
   - Secure credential validation
   - Rate limiting on login attempts
   - Session timeout

2. **Data Protection**
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection prevention
